<summary><h3>Edmond's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
My coding journey started when I enrolled in the Computer Systems Technology program at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT). It was there that I took a Java programming course and fell in love with coding. I spent countless hours practicing and building small programs, and it wasn't long before I knew I wanted to pursue a career in software development.

During my time at BCIT, I learned a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including Python, C, and Javascript. I also had the opportunity to work on several team projects, which taught me the importance of collaboration and communication in software development.

One of my most memorable projects was a web application I built for a local non-profit organization as part of a school project. The app allowed volunteers to sign up for shifts and keep track of their hours, making it easier for the organization to manage their volunteer program. It was incredibly satisfying to see the impact my work had on the community.
